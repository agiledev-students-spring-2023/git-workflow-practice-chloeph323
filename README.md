[Scientists Develop Alternate Positioning System That’s “More Robust and Accurate Than GPS”](https://nicenews.com/innovation/new-technology-could-replace-gps/) 
 
One of the projects I worked on during my interactive design class last year was a product idea for helping people keep track of their belongings - I called it Dots. Dots drew inspiration from airtag and tile but, instead of helping people find their belongings once they're lost (and perpetuating the cycle of losing and then looking for items), Dots attacked the lost items issue at its root cause by reminding people to return their belongings to their designated areas to begin with. 

Essentially, Dots functionality was dependent on being able to track whether a belonging was in radius of its designated spot. So, while researching to find out if this product was plausible, I looked into different tracking technologies and came across [this article](https://nicenews.com/innovation/new-technology-could-replace-gps/). I found it very interesting that the technology used proximity to track and even more so that it achieved an accuracy of 10 centimeters (with the team hopeful that it could be reduced down to 1 centimeter) - it gave my hope for the possibility of my Dots product.
